^^^Here are some additional things you can do to improve this project:

- You can add a command-line argument to the project so that the user can specify the name of the virtual machine and the operating system type.
- You can add a progress bar to the project so that the user can see how far along the scan is.
- You can add a feature to the project that allows the user to download the list of vulnerabilities.
